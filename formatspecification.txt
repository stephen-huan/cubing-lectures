Make a folder with some name.
Put the PDFs and other associated files in that folder.
Make a file called "desc.json" which should include these key, value pairs:
title, author, date, pdf, slides, tex

(slides is a PDF version of the slides, TeX is the LaTeX source)
Folder name should be the same as the value from the title key with spaces removed.
